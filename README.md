### Running React from local

```
git clone https://github.com/strifeserver/upload-frontend-test-react
```

```
cd upload-frontend-test-react
```

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------

Do adjust .env if backend will be running from the local too
for now frontend is connected to live/digital ocean
